Eggs do contain cholesterol but for most people they won't raise the level of cholesterol circulating in the bloodstream. Cholesterol is needed in the body and is the precursor of the five major classes of steroid hormones: progestagens, glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, androgens, and estrogens. These hormones are powerful signal molecules that regulate a host of organismal functions."
